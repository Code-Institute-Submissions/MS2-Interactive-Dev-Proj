# Worldwide Search for Hospitals and Pharmacies

## Milestone project 2: Interactive Frontend Development Milestone Project

The World Health Organization (WHO) has contacted me to design an interactive website tool to search  hospitals and pharmacies filtered by Countries and Cities. 
This initiative  comes out as a quick response to Covid-19 disease. This tool should be able to show listed  available entities on one side of the site and the other 
with a Google Map where all these entities are presented on it. The option as well of clicking on them accessing information related to the place.


## UX

The potential users of this tool are everybody in the full range of ages. There is no distinction of nationality or genres. The application works on a wide range of countries with all belonging to them. 
“Worldwide Search for Hospitals and Pharmacies” is a responsive web design and   responds to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size and platform. 
The website provides a very easy navigation on mobiles and small,medium and larger screen sizes.
